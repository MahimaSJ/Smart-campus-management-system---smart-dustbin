Creating a smart dustbin system is the goal of this 
project in order to combat inefficiencies inherent in 
traditional means of waste disposal. The smart dustbin 
employs ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensor, PIR 
sensor, and servo motor and the Blynk app so as to 
automate the opening and closing of the dustbin cover, 
detect fullness of bin and alert people using a phone. 
Primarily, it seeks to improve user convenience while 
ensuring efficient waste management.
